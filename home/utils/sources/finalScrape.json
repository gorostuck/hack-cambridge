I booked with this salon after being recommended by someone on facebook, desperate for somwwhere after covid and being new to the area. The person actually messaged me a few times after asking if i had booked which i thought was odd. The ladies were lovely, which is why i found it so hard to leave a bad review but afrer having my hair dyed and cut so many times over the year i am so dissapointed. I asked for a full highlights or ballyage if possible as i understand not everyone is able to do so. I showed photos and explained what i wanted, asking if it was possible. With some suggestion we went ahead and then had a much needed haircut which i hate to say was honestly was the worst ive had. Ive had to have it cut again and the lady warned me she would fix what she could but id need to wait for it to grow more before she could fully fix it, i was meant to be layered but just looked chopped. The hair colouring was dissapointing. I walked out with ombre looking hair which I could have lived with only my hair was so orange it was horrific. The colouring was done on virgin hair after growing out all the dyed hair, and as someone that has has had their hair coloured, bleached, etc multiple times, ive never had an issue with colouring. Ive waited this long to leave a review as i wanted to consult a colour specialist and make sure i was correct in what i was saying. The person was speechless and was even more buffled that such a bad job could be done on hair that was a blank canvas. I would have appreciated honesty if the result and what i wanted to achieve was beyond the capabilities of what the colourist could achive. It is going to cost me \\u00a3220 to fix the damage caused, so ive spent nearly a total of \\u00a3500.

When the direct debit came out of my account I saw I was charged \\u00a367.70 (NHS discount not applied). !\\n\\nI called the main line and they advised me to go to the store to sort this issue out. I went to the store and was advised I can not enter the store when I explained to them my problem. They kept letting other clients in and made me wait otuside in the rain. One of the staff came out and said if I don't like the contract and that I am being charged \\u00a367.70 to bring the phone back and he will refund me the money and he will cancel the contract and there is nothing else he can do. I advised him I am not happy about that as I have the contract in my hand for \\u00a348 not \\u00a367.70 he said he can't do anything and I should return the phone. Advised him I want to speak to a manager so he took the paper contract I showed him and went inside pretended to write some numbers in his tablet/computer. When he went inside he removed his name badge and came outside and said he is the manager and nothing can be done. I told him to call the main line and he advised me he won't call the main line as they can not help in any possible way. I advised him how it's strange and weird how I have a confirmation and a written contract agreement for \\u00a348 however when I call the main EE line they said there is no such contract in place and it's \\u00a367.70 a month. He then apologised and informed me that his collegue informed him I was being abusive (the fake manager). He then listened to my issue and concern and still refused to do anything just wrote in my file that I have a contract of \\u00a348 per month on hand written copy. I then had to call the main office and they resolved everything. I do not understand why they refused to call the main office and just informed me to cancel my contract.... Maybe the fact that they received their comission on a \\u00a367.70 contract and then make you cancel the contract and gave you a fake contract of \\u00a348...\\n\\nSo much headache, so many lies just to cover themselves up and will not help you in any way possible. AVOID THIS BRANCH AT ALL COST! Staff did not wear masks in a pandemic did not follow any social distance rules and did not follow any EE procedures and will scam you for comission by giving you fake contracts.\"], \"photoURL\": \"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/photo?maxwidth=400&photoreference=ATtYBwKlUmd1kpYx01K6Tt6vbdkiOpnKpn3mbueZ33eLEimLvcJJ7-P0MY2OPC8lzKXn7zfL9YxMa6qF63qNORCRqTDybWSvPLLQ7Vrab6gI_g4svrl2RjV-7DUQmhKF4WGKT5UbHHpdygG1miLhcQjQkd3BZdO0jhdskvy1EeO8vAXlj2tb&key=AIzaSyB1pM5fLZK2gtG689B6jM6SOwOD7fsKg14\", \"underrep_tag\": \"Disabled entrepeuners\"}, {\"name\": \"The Smile Studios : Palmers Green\", \"place_id\": \"ChIJcfQPkUAZdkgRZojv3kAABPU\", \"rating\": 4.7, \"types\": [\"doctor\", \"dentist\", \"health\", \"point_of_interest\", \"establishment\"], \"user_ratings_total\": 85, \"location\": {\"lat\": 51.6194129, \"lng\": -0.1138669}, \"reviews\": [\"Great dentist.

The system is a predictable one, one with which most of us are reliably familiar. You step into the place and are faced with racks of clothes on hangers and on shelves. You rummage through the assembled togs, either find something worth the money or, more often as not, don't, and if you have found the choice garment that will make you stand out from the crowd, where everyone will gasp in amazement as to how well dressed you are, pay up and leave. It's not a challenging or onerous task. Most of us are up to it, but it depends on for what you are looking. Let's be honest about clothes shopping for chaps. Most of us, men and women, don't actually give a toss about what we wear, because no matter what we wear, we all look alike enough for it not to matter. Whether you shop at Primark or are tailored from Tuscany, most of the time we all look the same. Jeans, chinos, linen, cotton. T shirt, buttoned shirt, sweat top. We all end up more or less the same. Same with kids. They hit 14, they realise that they have to compete to attract the opposite sex, they start buying their own clothes instead of wearing what their mums have got them, and they look alike. It's a tribal thing. So why shop at Jeff Banks? Why indeed. It all gets made in a sweatshop in Bangladesh or some other Third World factory, be it M&S, Tu, JB, or wherever, the only difference is the price. So by all means buy here if you are prepared to pay their prices for what you could get anyway else for less. The staff will be lovely wherever you go. Just don't let yourself imagine you are going to look outstanding by going here instead of somewhere else. We all look the same whatever we wear, and nobody cares that we do, because it really doesn't matter.\", \"Great store, great range and choice.
